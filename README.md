# Pacific Northwest PHP Conference (PNWPHP)

## Overview

The Pacific Northwest PHP Conference is a 3-day event (**September 15th-17th, 2016**) for PHP developers living in the Pacific Northwest region. Last year, we were joined by nearly 200 PHP developers, and this year's event is going to be even bigger. PNWPHP 2016 will be held at the **Cornish Playhouse**, which is a beautiful theater within the Seattle Center grounds, nearly in the shadow of the iconic Space Needle.

This year, our event will consist of a full-day of workshops, followed by two full days of an enthralling, single-track conference, with some of the most talented speakers from the PHP community and software industry.

We hope you will join with us for this amazing learning and networking experience full of food, fun, and friends.
