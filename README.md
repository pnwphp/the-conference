# Pacific Northwest PHP Conference (PNWPHP)

## Overview

The Pacific Northwest PHP Conference is a 3-day event (**September 7th-9th, 2017**) for PHP developers living in the Pacific Northwest region. Last year, we were joined by nearly 200 PHP developers, and this year's event is going to be even bigger. PNWPHP 2017 will be held at the **University of Washington**, which is a beautiful campus, nearly the heart of Seattle.

This year, our event will consist of a full-day of workshops at *Johnson Hall*, followed by two full days at *Kane Hall* of an enthralling, single-track conference, with some of the most talented speakers from the PHP community and software industry.

We hope you will join with us for this amazing learning and networking experience full of food, fun, and friends.
