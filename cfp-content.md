# Speak at PNWPHP

This year, PNWPHP is a single-track conference. If you are selected as a speaker, you will have the opportunity to deliver your message to the entire audience of 250-350. However, this also means we will be accepting fewer speakers than in 2015 (less than 20). We are looking for passionate speakers and pertinent topics that will engage the entire audience, and get people thinking, talking, and tweeting.

## Speaker Package

Because this is a not-for-profit, volunteer-run event, PNWPHP staff and speakers are not paid. However, we do our best to cover speakers' expenses so they can focus on their speaking, instead of the logistics of their trip.

This year, our speaker package will include the following:

* A full-access ticket to the conference - Includes the workshops day (9/15) and the main conference (9/16-9/17)
* Round-trip economy airfare to Seattle<sup>[1](#footnote-one)</sup>, and assistance getting to the conference hotel
* Up to 3 nights in the conference hotel<sup>[1](#footnote-one)</sup>, or up to 4 nights if international or involved with the workshops day (9/15)
* A special, "thank you" speaker dinner, graciously sponsored by one of our local companies, [Mercutio](https://www.getmercutio.com/)


## Speaker Agreement

By submitting a proposal to our conference, you agree to the following terms, if your proposal is accepted:

* You agree that you will put in the effort required to create and deliver a high-quality, original, informative presentation, consistent with your original proposal, that engages the audience to the best of your ability.
* You agree that you will act with a high degree of professionalism at the conference, adhere to the conference's code of conduct, and be aware that attendees may be looking to you as an example and role model in these and other matters.
* You agree that you will be responsive to communications from conference organizers prior to and during the event, be punctual during the event, and stay within your allotted speaking time for your presentation. Note: any time desired for audience questions and answers should be factored into the session time limits.
* You agree that you will put forth a reasonable effort to promote the conference and your talk to your network and employers in order to help us sell tickets and acquire sponsorships.



<a name="footnote-one">1.</a> If selected, speakers living in or near Seattle may be asked to forfeit or modify some or all of the travel and lodging benefits based on their location and if other travel methods (e.g., train, driving) make more sense logistically or economically. Also, a speaker's employer may choose to pay for and arrange some or all of their speaker's travel and lodging in exchange for conference sponsorship. Please contact admins@seaphp.com to negotiate this.
