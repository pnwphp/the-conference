# Request for Transporation

Dear {Speaker},

My name is Cory Fowler, I'm one of the organizers of PNWPHP. I'm emailing you today as we are missing a response for your transportation from/to the airport while you are in Seattle for the conference.

Could you please response with on of the following answers (it's quick and easy):

* I'd like to shuttle to/from the hotel
* I'll hail a taxi or Uber it
* I'd prefer to take public Transport (Please get me an Orca card)
*  

 Yes, the last option was left intentionally blank. If you don't respond at all within 48 hours, we trust that you've got this.

 If you would like the Orca card, we will ship it out to you so that you have it available for your arrival in Seattle.

 Thanks,

{Organizer Name}]
PNWPHP Organizer
