Hey {FIRST_NAME}

Thank you for being a Community sponsor for PNWPHP last year. We're hoping that you'll be a sponsor for us again. The conference is September 15-17, and coming up quickly, so let us know if you are interested so we can get your logo up on the website.

This year community sponsorships are only $50, and are available to user groups, conferences, podcasts, books, and individuals. If you have a question about your eligibility for this let us know.

We're really excited for the conference! We hope you will support our local PHP communities in the Pacific Northwest with a contribution.

Thanks,
{YOUR_NAME}
PNWPHP Organizer
