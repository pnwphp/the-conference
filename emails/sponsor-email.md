Hello {SPONSOR},

Thank you so much for sponsoring the Pacific Northwest PHP conference. We are so excited to bring an affordable conference experience to PHP developers in the Pacific Northwest, and we couldn’t do it without your help and support.

Our small, all-volunteer staff has been hard at work putting this event together, and it’s also our first time putting together an event of this size. Thanks for your patience with us. This email contains instructions related to the logistics of your sponsorship. Please reply to this email with your questions, with answers to our questions, and so we can issue you a coupon code to redeem your tickets (Bronze-level sponsorships and higher).

(Also, if we’ve sent this to the wrong person or there is a better person to send sponsorship details too, please forward this email to them and let us know who we should send it to in the future in your reply.)

Thanks to sponsors like you, we are able to fly in speakers from around the United States to Seattle, and introduce the user groups here to these great PHP leaders, making new connections and strengthening the PHP community as whole. You will also see that Seattle and nearby areas like Portland, Vancouver, and Spokane have a large pool of talent as well, and we hope that you and your company will benefit from the press and networking opportunities from this event. We have praised and will continue to praise you on our social media outlets for your contributions.

0. Sponsorship Prospectus

In case you would like to look at the sponsorship prospectus as a reference, here is a link to the most up-to-date version: http://pnwphp.com/pnwphp-2015-sponsorship-prospect... If you need a reminder about which sponsorship-level you applied for, please see the sponsors page on our website: http://pnwphp.com/sponsors.

Depending on your sponsorship level, some of the items below may or may not apply to you. If you have a question about something, please let us know.

1. Invoices

There are a few sponsor invoices I need to send out still. We appreciate your prompt payment of these invoices, since it is the main source of our operating expenses.

2. Employee Attendance

Are you sending employees to PNWPHP? Let us know so we can get some discount codes for you to register for their tickets. Our tickets are running out, and will continue to do so at a faster rate, so I’d like to get this taken care of ASAP. Please reply to this email and tell us:

- How many employees you are sending to attend the conference.
- If and how many extra employees you are sending to assist with your booth/table.

We will prepare discount codes for you to register for their tickets. Sponsors at the bronze-level, or higher, will have one or more free tickets. We will also give all of you a second code for a discount on other tickets. If you specify that you have employees coming to assist with your booth/table, we will also give you a third code for the special Exhibitor ticket which is only $49, and is primarily to help us with food costs for these extra guests.

3. Exhibitor Booths

The lobby area of the venue (Impact Hub Seattle) provides space for some booths. We will provide you a 5’ table, chairs, and WiFi, but you will need to bring everything else you need (including extension coords if you need power). Signs, raffles, demos, etc. are all allowed, but you’ll need to keep your area pretty tight around your table. On Friday, there will also be regular Impact Hub members at the venue along with conference attendees, so please do not bring or do anything that is noisy. These people may also be interested in your companies or products though, so feel free to talk to them. You will be able to distinguish conference attendees from the Impact Hub regulars from their lanyards/badges.

Setup will be from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM on Friday, September 11th, and teardown will need to be complete by 7:00 PM on Saturday, September 12th. The building is secured overnight, but it is primarily a co-working facility, so we suggest that you don’t leave anything that is both small and valuable overnight.

The lobby area is a very high-traffic area, and must be walked through to access every session at the conference. We will also be conducting a little game to ensure that each attendee visits every sponsor. Those who play the game are rewarded with one of four different colors of plush elePHPants, so they should be highly motivated to participate and come visit you. :-)

If you need to ship materials, you may ship them to the venue:

Impact Hub
220 2nd Ave S
Seattle, WA 98104

If you are only shipping small materials, or materials for the "Goodie Bag", you may ship them to Tessa Mero, one of the co-organizers of the conference:

Tessa Mero
5224 61st DR NE
Marysville, WA 98270

Otherwise, please bring your materials with you on the morning of September 11th. Parking is limited in the area; please see Impact Hub’s parking and other commuting suggestions: http://www.impacthubseattle.com/location? If you need access to the loading/unloading dock, please contact Impact Hub directly to make arrangements: 206-430-6007

The following sponsors have currently been allocated a booth/table: Nexcess, Tableau, MySQL, Joomla, and php[architect]. If you are on this shortlist, but do not want a booth, let us know. If you are NOT on the list, but you are interested in a booth (regardless of your current sponsorship level), please let us know, and we may be able to work something out for a reasonable fee. We have room for only 8 booths total, so this offer is on a first-come basis.

4. Website

Please visit http://pnwphp.com/sponsors to review your information as we have posted it. If you see missing or incorrect information, please provide us corrections.

5. Swag and Goodie Bags

At PNWPHP, every attendee will be receiving a “Goodie Bag”, which will include a program/schedule and stickers for the conference and materials and swag items provided by you. Every sponsorship level, including Community sponsors, are able to provide one small item (like a card, sticker, toy, or pen) in the Goodie Bag. Silver-level (and higher) sponsors may provide a larger item (e.g., flier, brochure, etc.). If you want to provide additional items, please let us know.

We are anticipating a full house of 200 attendees. If you are providing items in the Goodie Bag or printing or bringing materials to hand out, please plan on this amount. If you have extras leftover, we will be glad to distribute (or raffle off) your items at our monthly Seattle PHP User Group meetings. I suspect that the Portland and Vancouver user group leaders may want to take some back to their groups as well.

To include your items in the goodie bag, please contact tessa@seaphp.com

6. “Job Posting Board” and the “Job Seekers List"

7. Scholarships

We are offering scholarships to assist others to join the conference who aren’t able to due to financial hardships. If you’d like to make a scholarship donation, you can find the Paypal link here: http://pnwphp.com/scholarship
