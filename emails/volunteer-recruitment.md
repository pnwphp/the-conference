It's that time of year again! Pacific Northwest PHP is almost here, and we're looking for a few kind souls to help us deliver a great conference! We need people to help us during the Workshop Day (Thursday, Sept 15) and during the Conference (Friday and Saturday, Sept 16-17). As a reward, your ticket price will be heavily discounted.


Some of the things we'll need help with are:

* Directing lost souls upon arrival
* Posting signs
* Registration
* Cat Herding (between sessions)
* Set up Breakfast/Coffee 
* Set up Lunch
* End of Day cleanup
* Assisting speakers with their needs
* Assisting Organizers execute tasks


If you'd like to be a volunteer, get in touch with us by sending an email to admins@seaphp.com and be sure to include your: Firstname, Lastname, and Mobile Number.

Thank you!
