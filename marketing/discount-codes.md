# Discount Codes

These codes are to give out to provide discounts. Two possible strategies for using a code are: 

1. **Limit by Audience** - Give out to a specific audience, but keep it valid until the conference 
1. **Limit by Time** - allow anyone to use the discount code for a limited period of time
