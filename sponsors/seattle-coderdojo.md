Seattle CoderDojo is a free-to-attend meetup has been helping Seattle area kids learn about computer programming for over three years. We offer mentor-assisted self-paced training most Saturday mornings of the school year, with periodic instructor-led workshops. We're a club, not a school, 100% volunteer run and donation/sponsor funded. We're very welcoming of new families and new volunteers.
